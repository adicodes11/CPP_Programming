/*

In designing a game, we decide we want to have Monster, because everyone likes fighting Monster.
Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that can be one of
the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime.

Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string), as well as an amount of health
that represents how much damage they can take before they die. Write a function named printMonster()
that prints out all of the structâ€™s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using
an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().

Your program should produce the following output:

This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.
